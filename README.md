# Python Tutorial Series

This repository will hold a series of Python Tutorials dedicated to astronomers that are interested in learning Python. My idea is to have one of the Tutorials per month. This will happen during the Science Coffee time at the AURA Lecture Hall.

The material here presented was based on the material produced for the [Python BootCamp 2017 at IAG-USP](https://github.com/b1quint/PythonBootcamp2017).

Please, find the information and links for the existing presentations:

SUSD is currently working on a meta-package written in pure Python to reduce GEMINI data. This implies that astronomers will have to learn basic concepts of this language. As part of the user support, we will provide a series of Python Tutorials with the following format: 1.5 hour tutorial every 4 weeks with expositive and interactive material (exercises). Here is what I want to cover during the year:
