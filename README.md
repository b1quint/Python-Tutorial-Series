# Python Tutorial Series

This repository will hold a series of Python Tutorials dedicated to astronomers that are interested in learning Python. My idea is to have one of the Tutorials per month. This will happen during the Science Coffee time at the AURA Lecture Hall. 

Please, find the information and links for the existing presentations:

- Basics I [pdf]() [pptx](https://github.com/b1quint/Python-Tutorial-Series/blob/master/Presentations/Python%20Bootcamp%20-%20Basics%20I%20.pptx)
  - What is Python?
  - What will you need?
  - Python as a terminal
  - Python as a script
  - Types of variables
