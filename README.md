# Python Tutorial Series
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/b1quint/Python-Tutorial-Series/master)

This repository will hold a series of Python Tutorials dedicated to astronomers that are interested in learning Python. My idea is to have one of the Tutorials per month. This will happen during the Science Coffee time at the AURA Lecture Hall.

The material here presented was based on the material produced for the [Python BootCamp 2017 at IAG-USP](https://github.com/b1quint/PythonBootcamp2017).

SUSD is currently working on a meta-package written in pure Python to reduce GEMINI data. This implies that astronomers will have to learn basic concepts of this language. As part of the user support, we will provide a series of Python Tutorials with the following format: 1.5 hour tutorial every 4 weeks with expositive and interactive material (exercises). 

Please, find the information and links for the existing presentations. Mp4 recordings are available only to internal Gemini Users. If you need access, please contact me directly.
