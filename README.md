# Python Tutorial Series

This repository will hold a series of Python Tutorials dedicated to astronomers that are interested in learning Python. My idea is to have one of the Tutorials per month. This will happen during the Science Coffee time at the AURA Lecture Hall.

The material here presented was based on the material produced for the [Python BootCamp 2017 at IAG-USP](https://github.com/b1quint/PythonBootcamp2017).

For more information and excercises, access the [Repl.It Classrom](https://repl.it/data/classrooms/share/35396e379378bdf971abf2ca1c83b3df).
