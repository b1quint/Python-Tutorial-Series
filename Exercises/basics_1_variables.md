# PTS2019 - Basics 1 - Syntax and Variable Manipulation

* Review code syntax and make sure you can run it.
* Give a meaningful name for x, y, and z.
* Group code parts only using blank lines.
* Let your code breath by adding spaces before and after =.
* Check if it prints the expected output:
```
I bought 5 oranges
and I will give you 1.
Then I will divide between
 8 people.
Each one will receive 0.5 oranges.
```
