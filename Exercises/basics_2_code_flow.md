# Python Tutorial Series 2019 - Basics 2: Code Flow

This file holds a simple example of the basic Python code flow syntax. It
includes:

    - A method
    - A class
    - A if/elif/else case
    - A for loop

## Excercise

1. Find all the Syntax Errors before running

2. Debug why the cat is not eating the Meat.

3. Create a new class called Dog and write how it behaves depending on the food
   it eats.

   1. Create an empty class
   2. Add the _docstring_ explaining how it will behave
   3. Implement the actual code in a way it behaves as you explained

4. (Challenge) Add a "while" loop that will only stop when all the pets are not
   hungry anymore.
