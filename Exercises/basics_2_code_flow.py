Python Tutorial Series 2019 - Basics 2: Code Flow

This file holds a simple example of the basic Python code flow syntax. It
includes:

    - A method
    - A class
    - A sub-class
    - A if/elif/else case
    - A for loop

Excercise:

1) Find all the Syntax Errors before running

2) Debug why the cat is not eating the Meat

3) Create a new class called Dog and write how it behaves depending on the food
   it eats.

   3.1) Create an empty class
   3.2) Add the docstring explaining how it will behave
   3.3) Implement the actual code in a way it behaves as you explained

4) (Challenge) Add a "while" loop that will stop when all the pets are not
   hungry anymore.
